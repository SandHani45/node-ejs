          <h2>JIDDU KRISHNAMURTHY - About Where Can Peace Be Found?</h2>
          <p>Widely recognized as one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century, Jiddu Krishnamurti taught that in order for there to be peace in the world, we must each first make peace with ourselves. No spiritual path, leader, or personal or political philosophy will guide us in this endeavor, he said; this transformation of the human psyche is a truth that each of us must discover within. </p>
          <p>Here, Krishnamurti teaches that the war and destruction human beings wreak on each other and the environment are caused by our misplaced attachment to a sense of self and individuality that leads to aggression, competition, greed, and conflict. When we recognize that our consciousness is not individual but common to all humans, we can work together in a spirit of cooperation and compassion. Krishnamurti shows that taking personal responsibility for our actions and reactions—in our relationships and in our lives—is the necessary first step toward a global view.</p>

          <h2 class="text-black">How John Ruskin influenced Mahatma Gandhi? </h2>
      
          <p>In 1904,Mahatma Gandhi had a memorable encounter with Unto the Last, a book authored by John Ruskin. The book created a lasting impact on Gandhi on the basis of which he was able to chart out his political philosophy and actions.</p>
          <p>
              John Ruskin’s ideology consisted of three fundamental tenets. First, the good of an individual is contained in the good of all, a principle that Gandhiji knew. Second, the work of a lawyer and a barber is equally dignified as long as they adhere to ethical ways of living. This is the thing that Gandhi dimly realized.  Third, a labour involving physical labour, that is, the life of a tiller and a handicraftsman is a life worth living. Gandhiji never have had realized the significance of manual work before 1904 in such unambiguous manner.
          </p>
          <p>
              The amalgamation of John Ruskin’s teachings inspired Gandhi to devise his own political philosophy of ‘Sarvodaya’.The expanded meaning of sarvodaya is ‘equal upliftment of all’. Man’s ultimate aim, in Gandhi’s view, was the realization of God. In pursuit of this objective, a man needs to see God in his creation and be with it. The importance of physical labour is evident in Gandhi’s principle of ‘nai talim’ wherein he underscored that education is incomplete without the equal emphasis on intellectual development and manual work.

          </p>
          <p>
              Gandhi’s ‘sarvodaya’ is more relevant in the twenty-first century across the world. The concept of ‘inclusive growth’ is strongly rooted in the ‘sarvodaya’ principle. The real growth of a nation lies in the inclusive development of all sections of the society, not in the blind prosperity of a select few. Although ‘sarvodaya’ was a social ideology in fundamental form, it transformed itself into an urgent political doctrine after India gained independence.  Acharya Vinoba Bhave, socialist Jai Prakash Narayan and Dada Dharmadhikari were the torch-bearers of ‘sarvodaya’ and carried forward the ideals of Gandhi after his demise in 1948.

          <h3>Gandhi and Tolstoy have been the two greatest exponents of non-violence as a way of life and means of resistance</h3>
          <p>I sit on a man's back, choking him, and making him carry me, and yet assure myself and others that I am very sorry for him and wish to ease his lot by any means possible, except getting off his back. --  this is how a unique inbuilt and selectively ingrained amnesia in us makes us not only ignore the ugliest of the sufferings of mankind, but makes us believe that they actually do not exist. <br>
            "A Russian should rejoice if Poland, the Baltic Provinces, Finland, Armenia, should be separated, freed from Russia; so with an Englishman in regard to Ireland, India and other possessions; and each should help to do this, because the greater the state, the more wrong and cruel is its patriotism, and the greater is the sum of suffering upon which its power is founded. Therefore, if we really wish to be what we profess to be, we must not only cease our present desire for the growth of the state, but we must desire its decrease, its weakening, and help this forward with all our might."
          <br>
          Leo Tolstoy, from "Writings on Civil Disobedience and Nonviolence," written in 1886. 

          Two of the greatest minds in human history - India’s Mahatma Gandhi and Russia’s Leo Tolstoy - never got to meet in person. They exchanged letters over the course of one year. But the importance of their communication cannot be underestimated. 
          <br>
          "The greatest apostle of non-violence that the present age has produced” and a “great teacher whom I have long looked upon as one of my guides” — these are just a few ways Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948) described Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910). Born in different countries and in slightly different periods, they were representatives of different generations. The young and as yet unknown Gandhi looked for wisdom in the works of the already famous Tolstoy.
          <br>
          As the future leader of the Indian non-violent resistance movement later shared, the works of the Russian writer and philosopher had had a great influence on him. “Tolstoy’s The Kingdom of God Is Within You overwhelmed me. It left an abiding impression on me. Before the independent thinking, profound morality, and the truthfulness of this book, all the books given me … seemed to pale into insignificance,” Gandhi wrote.
          <br>
          The two great minds of Russia and India collided in 1909. The story started in December 1908, when anti-British Indian revolutionary Tarak Nath Das wrote to Tolstoy seeking his support for India’s independence from the British colonial rule. By then one of the most famous public figures, the Russian writer replied in a lengthy letter titled “A Letter to a Hindu”, which Das published in the Indian newspaper “Free Hindustan”. In short, Tolstoy’s message was that the only way for the Indian people to free themselves from the British was through the principle of love.
          <br>
          “Do not resist evil, but also do not yourselves participate in evil — in the violent deeds of the administration of the law courts, the collection of taxes and, what is more important, of the soldiers, and no one in the world will enslave you,” he wrote.

The text got passed from hand to hand and reached the young Gandhi in 1909. Still in the early days of his activist career, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy requesting permission to reprint “A Letter to a Hindu” in his own “Indian Opinion” newspaper in South Africa. The exchange evolved into a year-long correspondence that lasted until Tolstoy’s death in 1910.

                    The means we use to reach our ends are extremely important. Hopefully your "means" are kindness-centered and non-destructive. Often (possibly always) being kind is more important than proving you are right. When it is critical that you prove your point, remember to intertwine wisdom with compassion. Recent events would suggest that the human race is starting to learn that change can be achieved more effectively by mass demonstrations and peaceful means than by negative, destructive and hateful means.
