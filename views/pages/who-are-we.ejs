          <p class="mb-5">Osgan Peace Foundation is at the heart of all faiths, practices, and cultures, advancing peaceful co-existence is essential to ensuring productive, meaningful socially responsible and self sustainable micro societies with humanism as the Beej mantra to make this  a “one world one people” place.  
            <br>
            When we ask someone as to what do people want or seek , once the basic survival needs are met, the answer is without exception, we all want peace.

            </p>
          <p>Today there is unprecedented literacy, yet the education does not seem to have brought us any goodness, but only mental restlessness and discontent instead. There has been tremendous growth in our material progress and technology, but somehow we have not yet succeeded in bringing about peace and happiness or in overcoming suffering. We can only conclude that there must be something seriously wrong with our progress and development, and if we do not check it in time there could be disastrous consequences for the future of humanity.</p>
            <p>Today there is rising concern about the present worldwide moral crisis among all humanitarians and the need to making our societies more compassionate, What is peace, peace within and peace all around us. So let look at it, if we are not at peace within us, surely we are in bad company, then how can we be at peace with others.</p>

            <p >Which means we need to be at peace within us. Quite obviously, if we can not be at peace with our selves, how can we be expected to be amicable, decent and graceful in our conduct with others.
              To have inner peace, we need to re look at the growing or maturing of our children pre-teen age to begin with, followed by teen age pressure to decide on a career, and high scores and a great deal expectation.
              
            </p>
            <p >What is missing is a slight exposure and training in the form of a users manual to operate this wonderful machine known as human being. All animals have 5 senses, including human beings. Human beings have two additional attributes which separate us from rest of the animal kingdom, we have memory and imagination, both of which we have ended up misusing. Our mind is nothing but a thought generating gadget. With the lack of knowledge on how to use our mind. We end up using memories to fill us with a over dose of recollections / memories of all the past wrongs that the world and close associates and relatives have done to us. The other attribute called imagination, we are over working by constantly weaving horror stories, a quick look will reconfirm that almost none of our past horror stories have ever seen the light of the day. 
            </p>
            <p >
              What we need is to review, what could be done, can we subject our children in to a a more simpler, kinder and life where we are reasonably equipped to handle the internal mind clutter, where we are not constantly stressed due to irrelevant rat race and exposure to the manipulations of the few megalomaniacs and selfish beings. Technology is taken us to heights and places like never before, don’t we want to focus on making the technology work towards a lasting peace on earth, by changing the outlook of the social structure where we stop analyzing people on the basis of their earning profile or bank balance alone, human beings surely need to be able live and not just be doing jobs meaninglessly. Today the world suffers from the worst kind of slavery, one with zero coercion, and yet 100 percent compulsion.
            </p>
            <p >At Osgan Peace Foundation, our aim is to create consciousness about life is beyond, the I, me, myself, and without the other, life is meaningless, we are children of God and have the brains to comprehend that there is adequate on this planet for everybody’s need . let us get the greed out of us. As John Ruskin, author of the book, “unto this last, which inspired Mahatma Gandhi, to write and life by the book called “ Sarvodaya”, focussed to build a socially responsible self sustainable micro economy based culture, with larger focus on rural areas, to ease the ghettoisation, if a may use the word loosely for the constantly growing slums, in the cities, in order to cut cost and find cheap workmen. </p>
            <p >Today knowing that nearly almost a billion people are struggling for One square meal a day. The United Nations data, says, quote, “ Today, some 821 million people suffer chronically from hunger.</p>
            <p >Look around the increasing conflict zones, the proxy wars, the violence all around the world, and to which we are gracefully immune, and yet shamelessly believing that we are heading to a better more developed world than our ancestors. </p>
            <p >Don’t we think, it is time to start pondering, as to why are we becoming increasingly insensitive and sure if it is leading us to a better earth. It is not, and we see it all around, only our filters tell us that, all those things happen to other people, till we are caught right in the centre of it. </p>
            <p >
              We surely can teach a few tit bits of loving, caring and sharing at school level, get them to see around the realities of the world. None of us seem to have picked a wee bit of wisdom from Buddha, however, we are deeply engrossed in the pursuit of practice of his father, Suddhodhana, who forbade his son form seeing any reality of life.
            </p>
            <p >
              The Osgan Peace Foundation is working with educational institutions to bring about slight awareness and introduce the practice through experiential learning exercises outside the campus to imbibe moments of life which coerce each individual to look within and ponder on aspects of society which drive many of us from becoming socially responsible good human beings, by human, we mean loving caring sharing, beyond all man made borders and barriers.
            </p>
            <p >
              To conclude, Osgan Peace Foundation experiential learning initiative is for the people, by the people and of the people, movement in order  awaken, analyse and rise to need of adopting and practicing a culture, which makes us all proud of being good human beings. 

            </p>
            <p>This is clubbed under Socially Responsible Experiential learning, ' which is focused on competing with one’s own self, with inner basic instinct which drives us follow the teachings of the nature, which is captioned as “ we need to constantly Improve, and we don’t need to prove nothing but service of mankind to make this planet a loving place that it naturally is. Let us learn from the nature, the basic concept of loving, caring and sharing.</p>

            <h2><a  >The Story of an ‘Idea’ and its ‘Journey ’</a></h2>
            
            <p>While serving at UNAVEM and subsequently in MONUA, in Angola in the year 1996 – 1997, one of the founder-member had a series of discussions with the other armed forces veterans from almost 36 countries of the world on whose war and peace for whom, this was followed by several discussions with socially responsible people from many a Non Governmental organizations, with chequered profiles of tireless, selfless services, for decades in adverse or rather hostile environments obtaining in or out of conflict zones,   the civil society on the need to spreading awareness on peace.  </p>
            <p>The idea of starting a peoples movement, world over took birth from these concerns and talks, wherein it was concluded that only with the active participation  and understanding in grown from grass root desire of the affected people to end conflict through non violent means. This would need a series of social and cultural exchanges lead by both “the affected” and the “not directly affected” segments of the people from the cross section of the world populace.  </p>
            <p>And Osgan Peace Foundation stands firmly committed to ensuring that this movement is exemplary in practice of people standing shoulder to shoulder with the adversaries and not let or get manipulated by ever growing breed of megalomaniacs and fanatics, who two often a part of the larger conspiracies of the collective  or isolated vested interests.  </p>
            <p>It is only the common man who faces the brunt. This lead to the “HOW” which resulted in Osgan Peace Foundation becoming the platform, for the whole world to openly discuss, share, and launch programs for sustainable peace, or rather a culture with NO DISCRIMINATION, NO HATE, NO VIOLENCE, setting the past aside.  </p>
            <p>
